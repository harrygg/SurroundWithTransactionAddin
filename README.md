***
The SurroundWithTransaction ```addin``` is based on the great examples provided by [BorisKozo](https://github.com/BorisKozo/XmlViewAddin) 

# General
The SurroundWithTransaction ```addin``` will allow you to select steps in a script and quickly wrap them in a transaction. Right click
on a single step or select a few steps and right click on the selection.
![The selected steps in VuGen and the new menu item 'Surround with Transaction'](/img/surroundwith1.png "The selected steps in VuGen and the new menu item 'Surround with Transactions'")

Selecting the 'Surround with Transaction' menu will bring up the 'Enter Transaction Details' dialog. 
Enter the transaction name and select an end status.

The result is that the selected steps are wrapped in a new transaction.

#Compilation Note
To compile the project you must add *%VUGEN_PATH%\bin* to the reference paths of the project. If you have VuGen already installed,
the environment variable %VUGEN_PATH% will point to the installation folder.
There is a compiled version in the *bin* directory in the root of the repository. If you 
don't want to compile yourself you can copy the content of this directory to *%VUGEN_PATH%\addins\extra\SurroundWithTransaction*.
